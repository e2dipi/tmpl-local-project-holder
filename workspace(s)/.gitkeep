!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the project's **`working environment`**. Depending on the project's nature,it
    may hosts either a set of source files, a repository and/or a collection of subfolders containing
    subprojects. Note that in the case where this folder contains a single project, then it should be
    renamed in its singular form, which is `workspace` instead of `workpaces`*

<!-- ROADMAP Implement specific templates  for various types of subprojects and embed them here as GitHub Submodules [subproject] -->
