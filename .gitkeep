## Overview

This template provides a folder hierarchy for holding one or more projects sharing common
resources.  Its versatile structure is suitable for all sorts of projects, regardless of their size,
complexity, or nature. It is not meant to be used as a repository template, but rather as a template
for a local folder structure that will itself contain one or more repositories. Note that it is not to be
confused with a mono-repo either since its root folders are not meant to be versioned. The
contents of the `workspace(s)` folder, however, *may* be versioned by itself or contain multiple
subfolders, each of which being a mono-repo, a multi-repo or a simple folder.

The root folder splits the project into six main folders that cover the project's needs from conception
to production. Its tree structure is as follows:

<div style="min-width: 45em; font-size: normal; margin: 0 10% 5ex 5%;">

``` tree
   .                        ROOT FOLDER (Project's name)
   |                        ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´
   ├─ .bak                  # The project's backups and archives
   ├─ admin                 # The administrative environment
   ├─ deploy                # The deployment environment
   ├─ resources             # The needed resources
   └─ workspaces            # Dev environment
```

</div>

## The *.bak* folder

This folder hosts the project's archives and backups, which include the *continous backups*
performed by a tool like *VSCode's Local History* extension, an archive containing copies of every
release or deployment of the project, and any other, temporary or permanent, backup made by the
user. For ease and efficiency of maintenance, the latter are stored directly at the folder's root-level.

!!!Tip Subprojects' archives
    For projects that contain subprojects, it is more practical to let each of them have its own
    *backup folder* and, thus, its own `archives` folder as well. According to the above convention,
    the content of the latter should then be copied here. A better alternative is to define the
    subproject's `archives` folder as a symbolic link to this folder.

## The *admin* folder

The `admin` directory hosts the administrative environment. It contains information about the project
and its development, which includes the guidelines to be followed by the contibutors, the user's todo
lists, the reporting tools and their results' history and any information concerning the contributors or
the development's agenda.<br/>
*More info [here][admin-gitkeep].*

## The *deploy* folder

The `deploy` directory is the environment where deployments happen. Its content ranges from links
to remote locations where to copy files and folders to workflows and scripts that automatically
pack and deploy the code.<br/>
*More info [here][deploy-gitkeep].*

## The *resources* folder

The `resources` folder contains all the resources developers need to work on the project. Besides
"official" data, such as *development guidelines* that all contributors share, this folder may include
*personal* data, like *notes*, *to-do lists*, or potentially valuable assets.<br/>
*More info [here][resources-gitkeep].*

## The *workspaces* folder

The `workspaces` folder is the environment where development happens. It contains all the material
needed to develop, test, and build the project. Depending on the project's nature, it may consist
of one or more sub-folders, each containing a different workspace that may or may not be related to
the others besides being part of the same project's folder hierarchy.<br/>

## The Full Folder Hierarchy

The deeper into the folder hierarchy, the more project-specific the structure becomes. The overall tree, however, shouldn't be subject to major changes from one project to another. The folders to be found on its first two levels, in particular, should be generic enough to be used as is for any project. Changes, if any, should be limited to the third level and below, or consist of the deletion of folders that  are not needeed for the project at hand.

The *folder hierarchy*, thus omitting the files and, in particular, the `.gitkkep` ones that *every* non-documentation folder contains, is as follows:
