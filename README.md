<i>This template provides a folder hierarchy for holding one or more projects sharing common
resources.  Its versatile structure is suitable for all sorts of projects, regardless of their size,
complexity, or nature. It is not meant to be used as a repository template, but rather as a template
for a local folder structure that will contain one or more repositories. Note that it is not to be
confused with a mono-repo either since its root folders are not meant to be versioned. The
contents of the <code style="font-style: normal">/workspace(s)</code> folder, however, may consist of one or more repositories.</i>

## Install

As it is not meant to be used as a repository, this template is not saved as a *GitHub template* and,
 therefore, cannot be used to [instantiate a new repository](https://tinyurl.com/z427byf6).
 Instead, it is meant to be downloaded and used as a local folder structure template. To do so,
 simply download the latest release from the [releases page](https://tinyurl.com/4f3ekkzb) and
 extract it to the desired location. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and remove the `.git`
 folder<sup>1</sup> as well as all the files and folders that are not needed: the structure you should
 end up with contains only folders and `.gitkeep` files and is shown in the tree of the next section.
 Also, the `workspace(s)` folder should be renamed to singular or plural form according to the
 number of workspaces the project will contain.

<ol style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 10pt">
  <li>
      <p>
        Note that the <code>.git</code> folder is hidden by default. You may need to enable the
        display of hidden files and folders in your file explorer to see it. Alternatively, you can use the
        following command to remove it.
      </p>
      <ul style="font-style: italic; padding-left: 10pt">
        <li>In a <code>Bash terminal</code>:
          <pre style="color:inherit; margin-top: 5pt">rm -rf .git</pre>
        </li>
        <li>In a <code>PowerShell terminal</code>:
          <pre style="color:inherit; margin-top: 5pt">Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

## Contents

Each folder of the template contains a `.gitkeep` file containing a description of its purpose. In
addition, the folder `resources/manuals` contain several documents describing in more detail certain
aspects of the template and its usage, and suggesting some best practices and conventions.

## Highlights

Note that not all the folders come empty past their `.gitkeep` file. Some of them contain additional
information that is worth mentioning here:

- Various templates including seeding files and structured directories are provided in the
  `resources/templates` folder, including a `README` template to be used for instances of the present model. A brief description of each of them is available in the latter folder's
  `.gitkeep` file.
  <br/>[Click to open](/resources/templates/.gitkeep)

- Manuals about VSCode and some of its extensions are provided in the
  `resources/manuals` folder. They are available in *Markdown* format to be read in *VSCode* itself,
  using the *Markdown Preview Enhanced* extension. Alternatively, they can be read and converted
  to *HTML* or *PDF* using that same extension.
  <br/>[Click to open](/resources/manuals/vscode-custom-features/vscode-custom-features.doc.md)

- Guidelines and best practices are provided in the `resources/guidelines` folder. As the manuals
above, they are available in *Markdown* format and, thus, can be either read in *VSCode* or
converted to another format. At the time of writing, two guidelines are provided:
<br/>1. &nbsp;A detailed discussion on how archives should be named and organized.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Click to open](/admin/guidelines/handling-archives/handling-archives.md)
<br/>2. &nbsp;A brief presentation of the recommended Git Branching Model to be used.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Click to open](/admin/guidelines/git-branching/git-branching-model.md).

## Roadmap

Planned features and improvements as well as known issues and other topics of interest concerning
this template's development status are embedded in its `.gitkeep` files in the form of
[Todo Tree comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree). The most important ones are also listed here for convenience:

- [ ]  Implement the deployments' scripts.
- [ ]  Create type-specific (*JavaScript*, *TypeScript*, *NodeJS*, *GAS*, *LaTex*, etc ...)  templates
- [ ]  Embed the templates mentioned above as
[GitHub Submodules](https://tinyurl.com/2tykz6wr) in the [workspace(s)](workspace(s)/.gitkeep)
folder.
