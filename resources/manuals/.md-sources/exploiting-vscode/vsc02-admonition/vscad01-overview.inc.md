The typical use case for *admonitions* is to draw the reader's attention to a p articular point. They can appear anywhere in an ordinary HTML `body` element, including another *admonition*.

Admonitions consisit of a colored box with an optional header and a body. The header is composed of an icon and a title, both of which can be customized. The body is a normal paragraph of text.

Below is a quick example of multiple nested admonitions of different types:

<div style="width: 38em; font-size: normal; margin-left: 40pt; margin-bottom: 30pt">
<div style="font-size: 95%; text-align: justify;">

!!! note

    This is the **note** admonition body

    !!! danger Danger Title
        This is the **danger** admonition body

        !!! success ""
            This is the **success** admonition body, with stripped out title and icons

            As shown below, there are plenty of other types to choose from !
