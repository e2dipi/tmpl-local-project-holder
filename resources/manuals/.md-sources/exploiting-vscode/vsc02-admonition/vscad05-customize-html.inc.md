The HTML structure of an admonition consists of a  *division* container in which the header and every "chunk" of text in the body are considered as two separate *paragraphs*. Only the *division* and the title *paragraph*, are assigned a CSS class; the body *paragraph* is not. For example, the following `markdown code`:

<div style="width: 38em; font-size: normal; margin-left: 40pt; margin-bottom: 30pt">
<div style="font-size: 95%; text-align: justify;">

```markdown
!!! note The Note Title is considered as a paragraph
    And so is also the note's body, with the dirrernce that is not assigned a CSS class.

    It is worth noting that the body can be made of several paragraphs, as shown below.
```

</div></div>

will generate *note* admonition with both a title and a body.  The corresponding HTML code will then consist three distinct `<p>` elements within a `<div>`. More precisely, the generated `HTML code` will be:

<div style="width: 38em; font-size: normal; margin-left: 40pt; margin-bottom: 30pt">
<div style="font-size: 95%; text-align: justify;">

```html
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">The Note Title is considered as a paragraph</p>
<p>And so is also the note's body, with the dirrernce that is not assigned a CSS class.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the body can be made of several paragraphs, as shown below.</p>
</div>
```
</div></div>
