The extension [Todo-Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) uses [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to search the workspace for keywords like `TODO`, `FIXME` or `NOTE` and displays the results in an interactive *tree view* that can be sorted, filtered and exported. The `TAGS` it looks for can be customized, and it can also be configured to further bundle the results  into `SUBTAGS`. Those can also be highlighted in the editor according to a customizable color scheme. The following tables list the tags that are currently made available by the extension's configuration defined in [vscode-index.code-workspace](/vscode-index.code-workspace).

!!! INFO
    Note on icons The icons in use are the ones provided by the [octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) set. Due to poor and unstable support of colors, using alternative sets is not recommended.
