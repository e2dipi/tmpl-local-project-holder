# Assets Folder

!!!abstract
    This folder contains the **`assets`** of the project at hand, which are ready-to-use files to be embedded in the project's deliverables at build time. They  are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files, but they can also be  text files, such as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or  libraries, as long as the building process includes them as they are.
