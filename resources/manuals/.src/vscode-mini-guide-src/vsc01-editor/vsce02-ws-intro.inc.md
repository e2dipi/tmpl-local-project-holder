A `workspace` is a collection of files and folders opened in the editor. A  `single-root workspace` contains a single folder, while a `multi-root workspace` has several. The concept of a workspace enables VS Code to:

- Configure settings applying only to specific folders.
- Persist [tasks-link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) and [debugger launch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) configurations.
- Store and restore UI states.
- Selectively enable or disable extensions only for that workspace.
