The extension [Todo-Tree][todo-tree] uses [ripgrep][ripgrep] to search the workspace for keywords
like `TODO`, `FIXME` or `NOTE` and displays the results in an interactive *tree view* that can be
sorted, filtered and exported.

The `TAGS` it looks for can be customized, and it can also be configured to further bundle the
results  into `SUBTAGS`. Those can also be highlighted in the editor according to a customizable
color scheme.

The following tables list the tags that are currently made available by the extension's configuration
defined in [vscode-index.code-workspace](/vscode-index.code-workspace).

<div style="margin: 0 auto 5ex auto; max-width: 600px;  font-size: 95%">

!!! INFO Note on icons
    The icons in use are the ones provided by the [octicons][icons-link] set. Due to poor and unstable
    support of colors, using alternative sets is not recommended.
