!!!Abstract
    *This folder contains the **`assets`** of the project at hand, which are ready-to-use files to be
    embedded in the project's deliverables at build time. They  are typically binary files, such as
    images, audio, or video files, but they can also be  text files, such as configuration files, or even
    executable files, such as scripts or  libraries, as long as the building process includes them as
    they are.*
