The extension `markdown.extensions.admonition` provides the following syntax for admonitions:

<div style="min-width: 45em; font-size: normal; margin: 0 10% 5ex 5%;">
<div style="font-size: 95%; text-align: justify;">

```markdown
    !!! <type> [Alternative Title | "" to hide the header]

    <paragraph>

    <paragraph>

    ...
```

</div>
</div>

, where the  `<type>`  defines the overall style (icon and color) of
the admonition and the  `<paragraph>`  is a normal paragraph of
text. As an example, here is the code that generated the admonitions of the *overview* section:

<div style="min-width: 45em; font-size: normal; margin: 0 10% 5ex 5%;">
<div style="font-size: 95%; text-align: justify;">

```markdown
!!! note

    This is the **note** admonition body

    !!! danger Danger Title
        This is the **danger** admonition body

        !!! success ""
            This is the **success** admonition body, with stripped out title and icons

            As shown below, there are plenty of other types to choose from !

```

</div></div>

Markdown snippet above is provided in the last sections, strarting
