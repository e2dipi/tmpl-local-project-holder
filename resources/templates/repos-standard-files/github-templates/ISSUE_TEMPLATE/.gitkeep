## Overview

*GitHub issues* are a great way to communicate with the maintainers of a repository. Here, we provide three different templates, which names are self-explanatory:

- [bug_report.md](bug_report.md): to report a bug
- [feature_request.md](feature_request.md): to request a new feature
- [vulnerability_report.md](feature_request.md): to report a vulnerability

*GitHub* expects these templates to be written in *Markdown* or *Html* and stored in the
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) folder, at the root of the concerned
repository. *GitHub* automatically updates its interface according to the templates it finds. Then,
when a user starts a new issue, it automatically generates a form using the content of the template
selected by the user. Note that [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) can be used to
automatically label, close, or respond to issues
(more on this in Section [GitHub Actions](#github-actions), below).
