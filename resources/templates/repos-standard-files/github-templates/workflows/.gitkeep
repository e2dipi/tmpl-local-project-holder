## Overview

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are workflows that can be used to automate
certain tasks ranging from simple maintenance tasks to complex software development processes.
Each workflow is defined in a *YAML* file that must be stored in the
[`.github/workflows`](/.github/workflows) folder.

## Available Workflows

For now at least, the scripts implemented here are simple automation tasks that can be used by the
maintainers to automatically label, close, or respond to issues and pull requests. More specifically,
the following workflows are implemented:

- [welcomer.yml](welcomer.yml): welcomes new contributors
- [pull-labeler.yml](pull-labeler.yml): assigns labels to pull requests
- [pull-merger.yml](pull-merger.yml): automatically merges pull requests
- [change-logger.yml](change-logger.yml): uses git-cliff to generates a change log

Workflows are triggered by *GitHub* events, such as the creation of an issue or pull request. For
instance, the `pull-labeler.yml` workflow when a pull request is created or updated.

For detailed information about *GitHub Actions and Workflows*, please refer to the
[Official Dcumentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
