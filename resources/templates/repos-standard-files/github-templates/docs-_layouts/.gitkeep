## Overview

*GitHub* can generate a *GitHub Pages* site from the content of the `docs/_layouts` folder it
finds at the root of the repository. The `docs-_layouts` folder of the present directory holds a basic
template that displays the content of the [`README.md`](/README.md) file in a website-like format. The resulting site can be accessed at the following URL:

```url
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>
```

where `<username>` is the name of the user or organization that owns the repository and
`<repository-name>` is the name of the repository.

The generated site is further customized in the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml), which
specifies the site's title, description, base URL, etc.... More interestingly, it can specify the theme to
be used by the the site. For instance, the present configuration file uses
[Jekylll's midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight/tree/master/_includes)
theme, but there are many others to choose from in the
[GitHub Page's theme gallery](https://pages.github.com/themes/).

**!!! Note that *GitHub* expects to find the configuration at the root of the repository !!!**

For detailed information about the
configuration file and Jeckyll, see the
[GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/) and/or the [Jekyll weebsite](https://jekyllrb.com/).
