## Overview

This directory contains templates for the standard `Git` configuration files, namely: `.gitattributes`,
`.gitignore` and `.gitignore`. These files are meant to be copied to the repository's root folder. Note
that only  `.gitignore` which comes with only instructions in its comments is expected to need to be
updated on a per-project basis.

More information about the purpose and content of each template is provided in the following
sections.

## The *.gitattributes* file

This file is used to associate attributes with pathnames. It is used by `Git`
to match files and directories to attributes that tell `Git` how to manage
them.

**The provided template is expected to cover most situations and, thus,**
**to need little to no modification**.

## The *.gitignore* file

This file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that `Git` should
ignore. The provided template is empty and is meant to be updated using
[Toptal's generator](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) first, and
then to be completed with any additional file or folder specific to the project
at hand. More information about the generator and custom entries is
available in the template's comments.

## The  *.gitconfig* file

This file is used to specify the configuration of the `Git` command-line
interface and of the `Git` tools. The provided template sets up configuration
options concerning *Diffs*. More precisely, it sets up, on a per-file-type
basis, how `Git` should display the differences between the working tree
and the index, and between the index and the last commit. Such options
showed up to be useful in the context of `LaTeX` projects to improve the
readaility of the `texinfo` and `pdf` files' diffs.

**The provided template is expected to cover most situations and, thus,**
**to need little to no modification**.
