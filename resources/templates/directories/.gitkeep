!!!Abstract
    *This folder contains templates consisting in `folder hierarchies` like the `assets` folder. The
    included `.gitkeep` files were redacted such as being as generic as possible, but still typically
    need to be sligthly modified in order to match the project's context. If so and VSCode's Todo-Tree
    extension is used, the latter should display an entry about the needed `EDIT`.*
