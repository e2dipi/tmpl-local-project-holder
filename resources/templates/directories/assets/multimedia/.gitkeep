!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the **`multimedia`** assets, which  consist of the multimedia files that are
    neither `images` nor elements related to the `user-interface`. Such files typically consist of
    non-static contents meant to be embedded in the project and played using a reader that depends
    on the specific type of format of the multimedia file at hand. This folder partitions its contentes into
    two subfolder named `audio` and `videos`.Standard audio formats include
    [`.mp4`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14)
    [`.flv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video),
    [`.mkv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska), and
    [`.mov`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_File_Format).
    On the other hand, typical audio formats include
    [`.wav`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV),
    [`.mp3`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3), and
    [`.flac`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC).*
