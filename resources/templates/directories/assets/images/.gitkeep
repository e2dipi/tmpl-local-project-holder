# Images assets

!!!Abstract
    This folder hosts the **`images assets`**, which are the non ui-related graphical elements to be embedded in the project and that need neither a specific plugin to be diplayed nor further processing at build time. Typical examples include  `pictures`, `diagrams`, `charts`, `maps` and,of course, images of any type, including animated [`GIFs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF). It is worth mentioning that [`PDFs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) that are not strictly reserved to be downloaded.
