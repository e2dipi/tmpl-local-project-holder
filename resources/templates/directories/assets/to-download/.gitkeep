!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the assets that are not meant to be displayed, but rather to be
    `downloaded`. Typical examples of such documents are `ZIPs`, `DOCs`, `XLS`, etc... Formats like
    **`PDFs`** that the project doesn't display, but only provides as a link to download, should also be
    placed here.*
