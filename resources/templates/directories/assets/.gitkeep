# Assets Folder

!!!Abstract
    This folder contains the `assets` of the project at hand, which are ready-to-use files to be embedded in the project's deliverables at build time. They are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files, but they can also be text files, such as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or libraries, as long as the building process includes them as they are.

## The Assets Folder's Structure

The assets folder is organized in subfolders that group assets by their nature. The tree below shows the assets folder's structure and briefly describes each subfolder's content. For more details on each type of asset, please refer to the `.gitkeep` file of the corresponding subfolder.

<!-- EDIT The following tree may need an update [assets] -->

## What's an Asset?

Generally speaking, an asset is any file that is not a source code file but is part of the project. Assets are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files. Still, they can also be text files, such as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or libraries, as long as the building process includes them as they are.

In the context of the present folder, however, the term `asset` needs to be interpreted in a broader way. Here, we let the term `asset` refer to any file that may play the role of an asset in the project's development or that may serve to generate one.
