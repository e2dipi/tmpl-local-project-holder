# Resources Folder

!!!abstract
    This folder hosts the  user's personal **`resources`**. Its content is not necessarily strictly tight to the project at hand, but rather consists of a collection of potentially useful tools selected by the user based on the project's context. As such, part of it may be shared with - or copied from - other projects.

## Overview

This folder contains the user's personal *development resources*. Its contents are not necessarily strictly tight to the project at hand, but rather consist of a collection of potentially useful material selected by the user based on the project's context. As such, part of it may be shared with - or copied from - other projects. The folder is organized in subfolders, each of which is dedicated to a specific type of resource. The tree below shows the resources folder's structure and briefly describes each subfolder's content. For more details on each type of resource, please refer to the `.gitkeep` file of the corresponding subfolder.
