!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the  user's personal **`resources`**. Its content is not necessarily strictly tight to
    the project at hand, but rather consists of a collection of potentially useful tools selected by the
    user based on the project's context. As such, part of it may be shared with - or copied from - other

## Overview

This folder contains the user's personal *development resources*. Its contents are not necessarily
strictly tight to the project at hand, but rather consist of a collection of potentially useful material
selected by the user based on the project's context. As such, part of it may be shared with - or
copied from - other projects. The folder is organized in subfolders, each of which is dedicated to a
specific type of resource. The tree below shows the resources folder's structure and briefly describes
each subfolder's content. For more details on each type of resource, please refer to the `.gitkeep`
file of the corresponding subfolder.
