!!!Abstract
    *This folder holds the **`vendor`** contents which consist of any material procuded and, thus,
    maintained by a third party. The motivation for keeping such files in a specific folder is both to
    clearly identify the contents to be checked for updates from time to time and to exclude them from
    code analysis and other operations that are not relevant to them, such as linting, testing,
    documentation generation, etc.*
