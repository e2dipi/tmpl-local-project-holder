!!!Abstract
    *This folder contains the user's **`assets`** (library), which can be assets per se or any other file
    that can be used to generate such assets. The files to be found here provide assets that may be
    valuable for the project's development but are not, per se, part of the project deliverables.*

## Overview

This directory contains assets that are not, per se, part of the project deliverables but may be
valuable for the project's development. For example, its content may include widely used elements
that team members need to share or assets that a single member uses across different projects.

## What's an Asset?

Generally speaking, an asset is any file that is not a source code file but is part of the project. Assets
are typically binary files, such as images, audio, or video files. Still, they can also be text files, such
as configuration files, or even executable files, such as scripts or libraries, as long as the building
process includes them as they are.

In the context of the present folder, however, the term `asset` needs to be interpreted in a broader
way. Here, we let the term `asset` refer to any file that may play the role of an asset in the project's
development or that may serve to generate one.

## The Assets Folder's Structure

The assets folder is organized in subfolders that group assets by their nature. The tree below shows the assets folder's structure and broefly describes each subfolder's content. For more details on each type of asset, please refer to the `.gitkeep` file of the corresponding subfolder.
