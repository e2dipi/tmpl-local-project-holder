!!!Abstract
    *This folder hosts the assets that are not meant to be displayed, but rather to be `downloaded`. As
    all other user's assets, the files found here can be assets per se or any other file that can be used
    to generate such assets  Typical examples of such documents are `ZIPs`, `DOCs`, `XLS`, etc...
    Formats like **`PDFs`** that the project doesn't display, but only provides as a link to download,
    also belong here.*
