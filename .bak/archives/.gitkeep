## Overview

This folder hosts the project's *archives*, which essentially consist of backups of the project's
releases. Note that this folder also contains the archives of every subproject that the project may
contain. As a good practice, the contents of all archives folders should be mergeable with each
other. To archieve this,files must be named according to a predefined ruleset avoiding any risk of
collision. Such a scheme should also induce natural sorting and grouping of the archives in a way
that makes it easy to find a specific archive.

!!!Hint Naming Scheme
    <code><span style="font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold">
    &lt; prefix &gt; \~ &lt; descriptive-name &gt; [ \~ &lt; suffixes &gt; ] \~ &lt; vers|date|tag &gt; . zip
    </span></code>

A detailed description of each of the components of the naming scheme, including the list of values
that can be used for each of them depending on the context, is available in the
[handling archives](../../admin/guidelines/handling-archives/handling-archives.md) section of the
project's guidelines located in the `admin` folder.
