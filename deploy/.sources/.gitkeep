    <i>This folder hosts the <b><code>sources</code></b> that need to be deployed. It
    typically contains a copy of the latest version of the project (or of some of its subprojects)  and
    should be cleaned out at the end of the deployment procedure. Note that when deploying to a
    given environment, the sources are first brought from here to the target's own `.sources` folder
    before being deployed. That intermediary process also allows for the sources format to be
    adapted to the target environment's requirements, if needed..<br/>&nbsp;</i>
