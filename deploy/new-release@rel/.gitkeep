## Overview

This folder provides a *Target Specif Deployement Environment* that is dedicated to a given *type*
of deployment at a given *location*. Its purpose is to extend the common stored at the root of the
`deploy` folder with all the specifics of the deployment target at hand. As such, and to the exception
of the *target folders* that it obviously won't contain, its internal structure is the same as that of the
`deploy` folder's root. In particular, it contains its own `.sources` folder which purpose is to hold a,
possibly customized, copy of the `deploy` folder's `.sources` folder.

In order to simplify the deployment procedure, this folder may also contain a *junction*[^1] named
`targ-env$`[^2] pointing to the folder in the targetted deployment environment that the project must be
deployed to. As a good practice, this folder's structure should be preserved even in the case when
the common utilities of `deploy`'s root need not be extended. The motivation for doing so is to keep a
certain symetry between the different *deployment targets* and to make it easier to add a new
*target folder* in the future.

As a final note, let mention the [ln.exe](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html) *PowerShell* extension
which very efficiently handle *hard* and *soft* links on Windows. The `ln` command it provides
happens to be much more versatile than the nativee `mklink` command since, besides its ability to
create all sorts of links, it also allows to copy and move folders without breaking the links they
contain. Furthermore, its power can be brought to the context menu of the Windows Explorer by
installing the [Link Shell Extension](https://tinyurl.com/5n7md3yc) .

[^1]: *Junctions* are the Windows equivalent of *symbolic links* on Unix-like systems - i.e. links to
folders *or mount points* that are transparent to the user and the applications -, except that they
cannot reference files and that they can be created onlx on NTFS partitions.

[^2]: The `$` suffix to indicate that the folder is a *junction* was used instead of the usual  `.lnk` extension to avoid our link-mimics to be ignored by Git when using a standard `.gitignore` file. The `$` suffix should be changed for an `.lnk` extension for real-world use where these folders are, indeed, *junctions*.
