## Overview

This directory is where *deployments* happen. It wraps everything needed to deploy the project to
the concerned environments, which include scripts, actions, and config files, but also quick access to
the latest release(s) and links to the deployments' targets.

## The Folderr's Root Structure

The `deploy` folder's consists of three hidden folders holding the data that are shared by all the
deployments' targerts, to which add as many visible folders as there are deployments' tagets. The
latter represent the deployments' environment, which role is quickly presented in the next section
below. The folder tree is as follows:

```text
  .                         ROOT FOLDER (Project's name)
  |                         ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´
  ├─ .cmds                  # Contains the shared deployments' scripts.
  ├─ .config                # Contains the shared deployments' config  files.
  ├─ .sources               # A temporary holder for the sources to be deployed.
  ├─ archives               # An archive of all deployments, regardless of their target.
  ├─ production@host        # Mimmicks a folder representing a remote deployment target.
  ├─ vers-releas@local      # Contains everthing that is specific to deploying as a local release.
  └─ ...                    # As many additional folders as there are additional deploy. targets ...
```

A quick description of the role and contents of these folders is provided  in Section
[Structure and contents](#structure-and-contents), below.  For more information about each of them
individually, refer to their own  `.gitkeep` file.

## How Deployments Work

Each *specific deployment's environment*, also called a *deployment's target*, is represented by a
folder which name is of the form `target-name@location` and which contains the scripts and
parameters that are specific to the concerned deployment target. The deployed code is this
contained in the `.sources` folder.

To deploy the project to a given environment, the user simply runs the `deploy` script from within the
concerned `target-name@location` folder. This way, handling the deployment's permissions amounts
to simply granting or denying access to the different `target-name@location` folders. Also, as these
folder share the same structure, implementing the deployments' scripts such that they load their
parameters using relative paths is a quick and efficient way to ensure that they will run using the
settings specific to the concerned deployment target.

## Structure and contents

This folder hosts the project's `deployment` senvironment. It contains everything needed to deploy
the project to the concerned environments (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `testing`). The configuration,
commands and archives specific to a given deployment target lies in a folder named after the
concerned environment. The release(s) to be deployed as well as everything that is common to
every deployment is stored in the folders `.cmds`, `.sources`, and `configuration` at the root of the
present directory.

### The *.cmds* folder

The `.cmds` folder  hosts the deployments' scripts and commands that are common to all the
deployments. The scripts it contains essentially provide the deployment's core logic. They are
expected to be simple and generic enough to require very few, if any, changes not only from one
project to another, but  also from one deployment target to another. This is archieved by letting them
rely on other scripts for all the environment-specific tasks. Theses other scripts are stored in
subfolders which names are of the form `target-name@location` like, for example,
`production@local` (a detailed description of these folders and their contents is given
 [below](#the-target-namelocation-folders)).

As they shouldn't need to be modified once the project is set up, it is recommended to protect them
from any accidental change. The safest way to do it is of course to restrict their access to
administrators only, but doing so is not always possible or practical. Encouraging this practice by
making the `.cmds` folder hidden or, even, by simply marking it as such by adding a leading dot to its
name turns out to be a quick and efficient way to archieve the same goal, while keeping the folder
visible to all which is beneficial for the understanding of the project's structure. Also note that doing
so doesn't forbid to make the folder hidden or read-only for non-administrators as well in the case
when this would show to be necessary.

### The *.config* folder

The `.config` folder is the place where the configuration files that are common to all the deployments
are stored. The data it contains essentially concern the projects' specific structure and provide the
paths to the deployments' essentials, like the releases and the internal structure of the `deploy`
folder. As for commands, these files rely on specialized configuration files that are specific to each
deployment target for information with finer granularity. Then,  as for the `.cmds` folder, few
customization is expected, standard users shouldn't access those files, which, at least as a fiirst
step, we attempt to archivethe soft way consisting only in naming the folder `.config` rather than
`config` to point out that it is meant to be hidden.

### The *.sources* folder

The `.sources` folder is where the deployment scripts look for the sources to deploy.It is expected to
be a temporary folder that is used only during the deployment procedure and that gets cleaned out
at the end of it.  Note that before being effectively deployed, the sources transition by another
`.sources` folder that is internal to the targetted environments' folder. That intermediary step allows
for the sources format to be adapted to the target environment's requirements, if needed. Both
folders should be cleaned out at the end of the deployment procedure.

Note that in order to keep the `deploy` folder's root structure intact, the `.sources` folders themselves
are left alone and only their contents are cleaned out. As for the other deployments' tasks, handling
the content of the `.sources` folders is fully delegated to the deployment's scripts. This is the reason
why these folders' names  also sticks to the hidden naming convention and are preceded by a dot.

### The *archives* folder

The `archives` folder stores the archives of all the deployments, regardless of their target. its
contents complies with the template's guidelines described in `/admin/guidelines`. In
particular, as every other archive or backup folder, its contents are named after the dedicated
scheme described in
[handling-archives](./../admin/guidelines/handling-archives/handling-archives.md).

It is worth mentioning that the `archives` folder found in the subfolders representing a particular
 target are just junctions to the present one. This way, the archives of all the deployments are
stored in a single location, which makes it easier to manage them and to keep track of the project's
history. It also makes it easier to have them also backed up in the project's main archive, which is
 located in the `.bak` folder at the root of the project's folder tree.

 Also note that the recommended way to do the backup to the main archive mentionned above is to
 use *hard links* pointing to the files of the present folder. This way, the files are not duplicated,
 which is faster and saves disk space, while being protected from accidental deletion by the fact that
 *hard linked files* are not deleted until all the links pointing to them are removed. Under
 Windows, this can be done very efficiently using the
[Link Shell Extension](https://tinyurl.com/5n7md3ycl) which provides a context menu entry to create
hard links or its command line counterpart,  [ln.exe](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html).

### The *target-name@location* folders

Each `target-name@location` folders represents a deployment type. Such a folder holds the
scripts and configuration files that are specific to given deployment target and location. For example,
if a project is deployed to two production environments named, say, `my-laptop` and `my-drive`, the
folder `production` would contain two subfolders named `production@my-laptop` and
`production@my-drive`.

This template provides two such folders, namely `production@host` and `new-release@rel`,
that mimic the deployment of a project to some hypothetical *production site* and as a
*locally stored release*, respectively. The former is meant to be used as a template for the
deployment to any production environment. The latter implements a deployment to the `@rel` folder
of the present project's shell, which is the folder where the project's, and its subprojects', lates
releases are stored and exposed to the local file system. At the time of writing, though, these folders
only implement the stucture they will have and contain the associated `.gitkeep` files explaining the
role of their subfolders and how they are expected to be used throughout the deployment process.
The actual scripts and configuration files are still to be implemented and will be added as the need
arises.

<!-- ROADMAP This needs to be completed and the deployments' scripts need to be implemented. See .cmds/.gitkeep which already contains some docs about it! [deploy] -->

## The deployments' process

As mentionned above, the deployment scripts have not been implemented yet, and will be added as
the need arises. The corresponding documentation will be added here at the same time. The
following is just a sketch of how the deployment process is expected to work.

<div style="margin: 5ex auto 8ex auto; max-width: 600px">

!!!Danger CAUTION - The following is strongly subject to change!
    Do **not** consider the following as a reliable documentation of the deployment process. It is only
    a quick sketch that is strongly subject to change!

</div>

## The `deploy` command

The deployment process is initiated by calling the `deploy` command, which is roughly the only one
that should be called directly and which building blocks are the scripts found in this folder. In turn,
these scripts call the specialized scripts found in the target environments' folders. A brief description
of each of them as well as their general syntax are provided in the next section, below.

The `deploy` command' default is to deploy the contents of the `sources` folder to the `production`
environment, but options allow to select a specific project's or subproject's version to use as source,
as well any environment as target. Its syntax is as follows:

```powershell
deploy   [ [ -s|--source ] <source> ]   [ [ -t|--target ] <target> ]    [ -p|--project <project-path> ]   [ -c|--clean ]   [ -a|--archive ]
```

where:

```text
-s|--source <source>
´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´`´´´
    The source to deploy, which is assumed to be the name of a subfolder of the sources` folder.
    If not specified, the whole contents is considered a single project and deployed as such.

-t|--target <target>
´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´`
    The target environment to deploy to. If not specified, the `production` environment is assumed.
    Specifying `all` deploys to all environments.

-p|--project <project-path>
´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´`´´´´´´´´´´
    This option identifies a project to be copied to the `sources` folder before deployment. If this
    option is specified and the `--source` one is not, then only the contents of the `sources` folder
    that was just copied is deployed, regardless of what it may have already contained.

-c|--clean
´´´´´´´´´´´´
    If specified, the `sources` folder is cleaned out after deployment.

-a|--archive
´´´´´´´´´´´´´´
    If specified, the deployed project is archived in the `archives` subfolder of the target environment.
```
