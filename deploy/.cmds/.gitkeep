    <i>This folder hosts the deployments' <b><code>commands</code></b>. As they mostly consist
    of scripts that call the specialized ones found in the target environments' folders, they are agnostic
    of the target environment and shouldn't need much, if any, modification from one project to the
    next as long as the development environment is the same.<br/>&nbsp;</i>
