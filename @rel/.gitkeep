## Overview

This folders is meant to expose the distributions of the project and its subprojects to the local
system. It is worth pointing out that the exposure it provides should be considered strictly transient.
Indeed, not only are distributions passing by definition but, in order not to crowd the *working space*
folder too much,  projects that are not regularly worked on are meant to be either archived or staged.

The recommended way to share this folder's content is to rely on the *hardlink clone* mode of the
[`ln` command](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html#introduction) which, as its name suggests,
<i>clones a folder using hard links</i>. This command then has the double upside to provide
multiple access points to the exact same set of files and to ensure their sustainablity at the same
time, since the the file targeted by a hard link is not deleted until the last hard link pointing to it is
deleted.
